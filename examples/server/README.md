# parakeet-server

A small OpenAI-drop-in HTTP server for transcription, built on parakeet.cpp.
Point any OpenAI client's `base_url` at it and call
`POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`.

This is an example, not a production service. It serves one model, runs one
transcription at a time, and accepts WAV uploads only.

For a production deployment, use [LocalAI](https://localai.io), which embeds
parakeet.cpp as a backend and adds the things this example deliberately leaves
out: a model gallery, concurrency, multi-model serving, the full OpenAI API
surface, auth, and metrics.

## Build

Built by default with the rest of the project (`PARAKEET_BUILD_SERVER=ON`):

```sh
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --target parakeet-server -j
```

## Run

With a local model:

```sh
./build/examples/server/parakeet-server --model path/to/model.gguf --port 8080
```

With a published model by alias (downloaded once and cached under
`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/parakeet.cpp/models`, override with
`--cache-dir` or `PARAKEET_CACHE_DIR`):

```sh
./build/examples/server/parakeet-server --model tdt_ctc-110m-q4_k
```

`--model` accepts a local `.gguf` path, an `http(s)://` URL, a `<name>.gguf`
filename in the `mudler/parakeet-cpp-gguf` repo, or one of these aliases:

| Alias                | Model                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `tdt_ctc-110m`       | hybrid TDT+CTC 110M (f16)               |
| `tdt_ctc-110m-q4_k`  | hybrid TDT+CTC 110M (q4_k, smallest)    |
| `tdt_ctc-1.1b`       | hybrid TDT+CTC 1.1B (f16)               |
| `tdt-0.6b-v2`        | TDT 0.6B v2 (f16)                       |
| `tdt-0.6b-v3`        | TDT 0.6B v3, multilingual (f16)         |
| `tdt-1.1b`           | TDT 1.1B (f16)                          |
| `ctc-0.6b`           | CTC 0.6B (f16)                          |
| `ctc-1.1b`           | CTC 1.1B (f16)                          |
| `rnnt-0.6b`          | RNN-T 0.6B (f16)                        |
| `rnnt-1.1b`          | RNN-T 1.1B (f16)                        |
| `eou-120m`           | realtime EOU 120M (f16)                 |
| `redux-trq`          | parakeet-redux ternary TRQ1_0, 2.125 bpw |

An alias value may be `<owner>/<repo>/<file>` to resolve inside a repo other
than the shared collection -- that is how `redux-trq` is served from this
fork's own Hugging Face repo without repointing `kCollectionRepo`.

Downloads use `curl` (or `wget`). If neither is on `PATH`, download the `.gguf`
yourself and pass the local path.

## Docker

A prebuilt image is published per push to `ghcr.io/<owner>/parakeet.cpp-server`
(CPU by default, `:latest-cuda` for the CUDA build). It binds `0.0.0.0` and
exposes port 8080. Pass the same `--model` argument you would on the CLI;
mount a local `.gguf`, or let it fetch an alias on first run:

```sh
# serve a published model by alias (downloaded into the container)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/mudler/parakeet.cpp-server --model tdt_ctc-110m

# serve a local model (mount it read-only)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "$PWD/model.gguf:/model.gguf:ro" \
  ghcr.io/mudler/parakeet.cpp-server --model /model.gguf
```

## Call it

```sh
curl -F file=@audio.wav -F response_format=verbose_json \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions
```

With the OpenAI Python client:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", api_key="not-needed")
with open("audio.wav", "rb") as f:
    print(client.audio.transcriptions.create(model="parakeet", file=f).text)
```

## Supported

- `response_format`: `json` (default), `text`, `verbose_json`.
- `timestamp_granularities[]=word` adds a `words` array to `verbose_json`.

## Known simplifications

- WAV uploads only. Other formats return 400. Convert with ffmpeg first.
- `verbose_json` emits a single `segment` spanning the whole transcript;
  Parakeet has no native segmentation. Word timestamps are real.
- `language` in `verbose_json` is a fixed `en` placeholder.
- `model` in the request is accepted but ignored; the process serves the one
  model given to `--model`.
- `temperature` and `prompt` are accepted and ignored (greedy decode).
- Inference is serialized by a mutex. For real parallelism, hold a pool of
  `pk::Model` contexts instead of one.
